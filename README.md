**v2 offers all functionalities needed, but the approach of using only String to represent all values causes the service's 
logic to become massive and hard to follow.

to make the code cleaner and to achieve readability,
I decided to introduce new classes each class
represents an important component in the car
harness cable such as connector, wire 
and  module...

while I'm working on this project alone at the moment. v3 will take actions to make the project scalable and easy to tag alone,
also achieve better performance.**
